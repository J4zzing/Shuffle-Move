<div style="text-align: center;"><big style="text-decoration: underline;">Basic usage:</big><br>
</div><ol>
  <li>Set up your roster - the levels for each species you currently
have access to. To do this either press Ctrl-R or go to Roster &gt; Edit<br>
  </li>
  <li>Set up your team(s) - the set of blocks which can be used for
each stage. To do this either press Ctrl-T or go to Team &gt; Edit</li>
  <li>Use the primary interface in either Paint or Express entry mode
to edit the current board. See below for details on each. Press 'f' to toggle frozen, depending on the mode and your configuration.</li>
  <li>As you edit the board, the optimal move will change (if the board
is in a possibly finished state). See the move indicator section below
for details.</li>
  <li>You can clear the board with Ctrl-Delete, and change the board to
the predicted state after the best move with Ctrl-Enter.</li>
  <li>You can save all your data to file with Ctrl-S and reload from
your saved data with Ctrl-L. You can also individually save some
components on their own - Board, Roster, or Team. Board includes the
current board state and the stage, Roster includes the entire roster,
and Team includes all your configured stage-team settings.<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Note: This window will
automatically launch if you do not have a saved board configuration at
./boards/board.txt</span><br><br>
<big style="text-decoration: underline;">Roster Editing:</big><br></div><div style="text-align: center;">
(this is for editing the levels of your available species)<br></div>
There are a few filters which can change which species are visible.<br>
<ul>
  <li>Type: If something other than "No Filter" is selected, then only
species of the selected type will be included.</li>
  <li>Level: Only species of this level or higher will be included.</li>
  <li>Name: Only species whose name contains this case insensitive
string will be included.</li>
  <li>Effect Chooser: Only species whose primary effect matches this will be included, if something other than "No Filter" is selected.</li>
  <li>Mega Only: If selected, only those with a mega evolution configured will be included. Otherwise all are included.</li>
  <li>You can also filter by the current team, by selecting the "Team" option at the bottom of the window.</li>
</ul>
At any time, you can press the "Set Level For All" button to change the
level for one or more species depending on the following conditions:<br>
<ul>
  <li>If there are no species present, and the display would not be
empty for a level filter of 0, then those species are set to the
current filter level.</li>
  <li>If there are no species present, but the display would still be
empty for a level filter of 0, then all species will be set to the
current filter level.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise, only the visible species will be set to the given
level. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
For individual species, you can change their level by clicking the
number under their icon and selecting the new level.<br>
<br>
To see the specific Name, Attack, Type, and Effect for any entry in the
roster, simply select it by clicking either its name or its icon.<br>
<br>
To apply your settings, click Apply or OK. OK and Cancel will close the
window. Closing the window via the system close button will behave the
same as if you pressed Cancel and will not save your changes.<br>
<br><div style="text-align: center;">
<big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Team Editing:</span></big><br><big><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></big></div><big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
</span></big><div style="text-align: center;">(this is for changing the available blocks for each stage)<br></div>
There same filters from the Roster Editor are available in the Team
Editor window. See above for details.<br>
<br>
Teams are saved on a stage-by-stage basis. If a stage has no registered
team, it will fall back firstly to the unnamed stage for that type,
then if that is not available it will proceed to the first (by the
stages.txt config) stage to match the same type with the largest number
of configured team members.<br>
<br>
You can clear the current team by pressing "Clear Team". If you are
currently using the fallback, this will switch you to an empty team.
Ifyou are not currently using the fallback, this will switch you to the
first fallback team as described above.<br>
<br>
To add a species to the current team, click its "Add" button. To
remove, press the "R" button in the team panel on the right. You can
add or remove the Wood and Metal blocks via checkboxes on the right
side of the interface.<br>
<br>
The mega slot (the first slot in the game's interface for a stage)
should be set appropriately. If you have already begun the stage and
your mega is active, please select the 'active' checkbox to let the
program know that it has mega evolved. The icon should change to
confirm this. If you have not yet mega evolved the mega slot, 
set the value to the right of the activate button to the number of
blocks matched. A cross of two x3 matches produces 6, not 5. Mega boost
increases this by 3. The simulation will automatically increase it if you
use the 'do move' button appropriately (although errors due to randomness
may occur, so please check that it matches your game's mega guage).<br>
<br>
Hotkeys for all team members can be seen under their icons. Please note
that newly added species will inherit the most popular keybind you have
chosen in the past for that species, or by the order configured in
config/other.txt. You can change this to any valid keybind, but the
preferred keybinds are usually much more efficient for rapid entry in
express entry mode.<br>
<br>
The same OK, Apply, and Cancel behavior from the Roster Editor applies
for the Team Editor.<br>
<br><div style="text-align: center;">
<big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Entry Modes:</span></big><br></div>
Pressing tab will switch between entry modes. Pressing f or F will
toggle the frozen state depending on the current mode.<br>
Painting mode allows you to paint by clicking and dragging around on
the grid. You can delete blocks by right clicking and dragging. You can
change the current paint by using the keybinds for
frozen (f/F are the default hotkeys) and the team keybinds for the
species.<br>
Express mode allows you to paint by pressing the keybinds for frozen
(to freeze the previous cell) or the team keybinds to paint the species
at the current position and advance by one cell. You can skip a cell by
pressing space, and go back one by pressing backspace. You can also
move the current cursor anywhere by clicking and/or dragging the mouse
on the grid.<br>
<br><div style="text-align: center;">
<big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Move Display:</span>
</big><br></div>
The best move for the current board is updated every time the board,
your roster, or your team changes. The colors displayed indicate the
from and to block outlines on the grid. You should drag the block from
the indicated pickup tile to the indicated drop-off tile to have the
best chance at getting an awesome result in the current stage.<br>
You can configure this from the Move menu's Preferences option to use
a simulation based on more than one version of the potential cascades. 
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Beware, setting these values too
high will cause a long delay before results are returned (using a 
lot of CPU too). I am not responsible if you break your computer by setting these
too high (extreme processor strain).<br></span>
 <div style="text-align: center;"><br>
<big><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Move Chooser:</span>
</big><br></div>
You can now select moves from a list of valid moves, ranked by your
 chosen metric. Try them out to see their usefulness. Sticking with just
 one metric may produce unfavorable boards in the long term. The default
is to rank by descending score, but the others are viable for different
situations such as a highly disrupted board (disruptions), or
 weekend Meowth (all or none).
